<Tip>
**A a few useful tips**
+ The configuration methods are useful to get the static lists of data we use throughout the database.
  - You can find things like the languages, countries, timezones and translations that we use. The configuration method also holds useful image information.
+ Understanding the basics of our authentication is useful. You can read about this here.
+ We enforce some amount of rate limiting on the API. You can read about that here.
