Authenticating Your Request.

TMDb API offers two authentication methods: **API keys** and **Bearer token** authentication.

Note: You can use only one method at a time.

## Things you need to know

- The API registration page is only accessible on a desktop browser, not on mobile.
- You must accept our terms of use to receive an API key. Read them [here](#).

To access TMDB API, you'll need to authenticate with either an API key or an access token (which can be used as a bearer token).
Follow the steps below to obtain these credentials.

1. [Login](https://www.themoviedb.org/login) to your TMDB account (or create a new account if you don't have one).
   You'll be redirected to your TMDB dashboard.
   <img
    className="block dark:hidden"
    src="/images/tmdb-dashboard.png"
    alt="tmbd dashboard"
    />
    <img
    className="hidden dark:block"
    src="/images/tmdb-dashboard.png"
    alt="tmbd dashboard"
    />

2.  On the top-right corner of your dashboard, click on the account icon. From the dropdown-menu, select **settings**.
    <img
    className="block dark:hidden"
    src="/images/tmdb-settings.png"
    alt="account settings"
    />
    <img
    className="hidden dark:block"
    src="/images/tmdb-settings.png"
    alt="account settings"
    />

3.  On the **settings** menu, selet **API**. Scroll to the bottom to find the **API Read Access Token** and **API key**. You can copy any of the credentials to use for authentication.
    <img
    className="block dark:hidden"
    src="/images/tmdb-credentials.png"
    alt="API credentials"
    />
    <img
    className="hidden dark:block"
    src="/images/tmdb-credentials.png"
    alt="API credentials"
    />

<Info>
    Using the bearer token has an added benefit of being a single authentication process that you can
    use across both the v3 and v4 methods.
