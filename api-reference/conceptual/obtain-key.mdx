To access TMDB API, you'll need to authenticate with either an API key or an access token (which can be used as a bearer token).
Follow the steps below to obtain these credentials.

1. [Login](https://www.themoviedb.org/login) to your TMDB account (or create a new account if you don't have one).
   You'll be redirected to your TMDB dashboard.

    <img
    className="hidden dark:block"
    src="/images/tmdb-dashboard.png"
    alt="tmbd dashboard"
    />

2.  On the top-right corner of your dashboard, click on the account icon. From the dropdown-menu, select **settings**.

    alt="account settings"
    />
    <img
    className="hidden dark:block"
    src="/images/tmdb-settings.png"
    alt="account settings"
    />

3.  On the **settings** menu, selet **API**. Scroll to the bottom to find the **API Read Access Token** and **API key**. You can copy any of the credentials to use for authentication.

    />

    alt="API credentials"
    />

<Info>
    Using the bearer token has an added benefit of being a single authentication process that you can
    use across both the v3 and v4 methods.
