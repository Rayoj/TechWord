TMDB API uses Application level authentication. You can either authenticate with an **api_key** or by using your **access token** as a Bearer token.
To learn how to obtain these credentials, please visit the **Authentication** page for details.
<Info>
    Using the bearer token has an added benefit of being a single authentication process that you can
    use across both the v3 and v4 methods.
</Info>


## Authenticate with Bearer token
To authenticate with your bearer token, you'll have to obtain the **API Read Access Token**
 from your dashboard (see **obtain api key**), then send it along as an Authorization header - See cURL example below.

```
curl --request GET \
     --url 'https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/11' \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJhdWQiOiIzNDExYjEzMDZlZjc4YWM4NTliZGI1YzZlZWFkNTIyOSIsIm5iZiI6MTczMzc1MzU2OS4yMTcsInN1YiI6IjY3NTZmYWUxOGIyY2MyNzg4YjExZGUzOCIsInNjb3BlcyI6WyJhcGlfcmVhZCJdLCJ2ZXJzaW9uIjoxfQ.x5-zdG_Pxfdpidu80KgSm0i3kMFVl2vSnIR2I3NiR8M'
```

## session_id, guest_session_id, and account_id, 
There are other credentials necessary to access some endpoints on TMDB. 
This section explains in details, how to get each of these credential.

### session_id (User authentication)
The endpoints in **Authentication** section of this docs allows you to authenticate users so they can do things like, rate movies, 
add to favourite, as well as create and edit custom list in your application 
while staying in sync with their TMDB account.

This is controlled with a session_id parameter. 
**Follow the steps below to generate a session_id:**
#### 1. Create a new request token
The **create-request-token** endpoint allows you to request a new token. 
This is a temporary token, required to ask the user for permission to access their account 
and will expire automatically after 60 minutes, if not used.
<img
    className="block dark:hidden"
    src="/images/request-token.png"
    alt="account_id"
    />
    <img
    className="hidden dark:block"
    src="/images/request-token.png"
    alt="account_id"
    />
    *example request token*
#### 2. Ask the user for permission
Using the request token from the previous request, replace with **REQUEST TOKEN** 
in the url below and forward to your user.
```Example
https://www.themoviedb.org/authenticate/{REQUEST_TOKEN}
```
This will enable the TMDB user to approve your request from their end.
<img
    className="block dark:hidden"
    src="/images/user-auth.png"
    alt="account_id"
    />
    <img
    className="hidden dark:block"
    src="/images/user-auth.png"
    alt="account_id"
    />
You can also add a redirect parameter to the url if you have a page you want the user to arrive at, after authenticating.

#### 3. Create session_id
Once the request token has been approved by the user, use the create-session endpoint, 
with the approved request token as body parameter, to request for a session_id.

<img
    className="block dark:hidden"
    src="/images/session-id.png"
    alt="account_id"
    />
    <img
    className="hidden dark:block"
    src="/images/session-id.png"
    alt="account_id"
    />

<Info>
    You will need the session_id as a parameter for subsequent requests. 
    So you should treat it like a password and keep it safe.
</Info>

### guest_session_id
Guest sessions are special kind of session that gives users the functionality of an account 
like, rate a movie etc. without having a registered account on TMDB.

To create a Guest session, use the create-guest-session endpoint. If the request is successful,
you will recieve a guest session_id like so:
<img
    className="block dark:hidden"
    src="/images/guest-session.png"
    alt="account_id"
    />
    <img
    className="hidden dark:block"
    src="/images/guest-session.png"
    alt="account_id"
    />
<Info>
   Guest sessions will automatically be deleted if they are not used withn 60 minutes of being issued.
</Info>


### account_id
This is a unique Id for a user's account and a required parameter for all accounts endpoints. 
It allow users to add or remove personalized informaton from a users account, and is 
automatically generated once a user logs in to their TMDB account.
#### To find your account_id, you can either use the endpoint:
```
BaseUrl/account?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY&session_id=YOUR_SESSION_ID
```

or 

- Login to your tmdb account on the API reference docs 
- Check the account_id path parameter for any accounts endpoint.
<img
    className="block dark:hidden"
    src="/images/account-id.png"
    alt="account_id"
    />
    <img
    className="hidden dark:block"
    src="/images/account-id.png"
    alt="account_id"
    />
