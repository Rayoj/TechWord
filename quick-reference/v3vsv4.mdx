Version 4 (v4) of our list API introduces several enhancements over version 3 (v3). While v3 lists remain functional, upgrading to v4 unlocks additional features and improvements.

Key benefits of v4 lists include:

- Importing an unlimited number of items in a single request.

- Support for mixed-type lists (both movies and TV shows).

- The ability to create private lists.

- Adding and using comments for individual items.

- More sorting options.

- Improved performance and speed.
