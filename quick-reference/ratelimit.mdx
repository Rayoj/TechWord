As of December 16, 2019, the original API rate limiting (40 requests per second) has been disabled. Please, if you need more information about this, check out our [API support forum](https://www.themoviedb.org/talk/category/5047958519c29526b50017d6).

Although our legacy rate limits have been inactive for a while, we still enforce upper limits to prevent excessive bulk scraping. 

## Rate Limit

<Note>
    This limit can change at any time, so you need to respect the service we have built to avoid getting an <code>Error 429</code>.
