TMDB API Reference Documentation

## Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive API reference documentation for The Movie Database (TMDB), built using Mintlify. It provides developers with a structured guide to 100+ API endpoints, covering authentication, retrieving movie and TV show data, and more.

## Project Steps
1. Setting Up TMDB API Access:
- Created an account on TMDB.
- Obtained the necessary credentials, including the API key.

## 2. Reviewing the TMDB API
- Conducted a thorough review of the official TMDB API documentation.
- Examined all available API endpoints to understand their functionality and use cases.

## 3. Testing API Endpoints
- Tested each TMDB API endpoint using Postman.
- Verified responses, checked for errors, and documented different request parameters, descriptions, and expected responses.
## 4. Documenting API Endpoints in Postman
- Created a structured Postman collection for TMDB API.
- Documented each endpoint with details such as parameters, request/response formats, and descriptions.
## 5. Transitioning to OpenAPI Specification
- Exported the documented API endpoints from Postman to an OpenAPI spec file.
- Converted the JSON file to YAML using TWMP’s OpenAPI spec converter.
- Edited and refined the OpenAPI spec using Swagger Editor and VS Code.
- Conducted further testing to ensure accuracy.
## 6. Building Documentation with Mintlify
- Signed up on Mintlify and linked my GitHub account.
- Started creating the API documentation on Mintlify, covering:
- Introduction
- Authentication
- How to obtain an API key
- API reference
- API essentials

- Customized the documentation’s look and feel using Mintlify components and custom CSS.

Conclusion
This documentation provides a well-structured, developer-friendly reference for the TMDB API, improving accessibility, usability, and overall user experience.
