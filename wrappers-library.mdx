##

Many developers have created community-contributed wrappers and libraries to make working with the TMDB API easier. 
These tools handle tasks such as authentication, URL formatting, and error management, streamlining the integration of TMDB data into your projects. 

### Advantages of Using Wrappers

- **Easier API Integration:**  
  Wrappers streamline API interactions by managing setup, request formatting, and response parsing, reducing repetitive code.

- **Automated Error Handling:**  
  Many libraries come with built-in mechanisms to handle errors, including rate limits and API failures, ensuring smoother operation.

- **Active Community & Updates:**  
  Well-maintained wrappers are regularly updated by the developer community, keeping them compatible with the latest TMDB API changes.

### Below are some of the most popular wrappers.

- **Ruby:**

tmdb = TMDb()
tmdb.api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'

movie = Movie()
results = movie.search('Inception')
print(results)
